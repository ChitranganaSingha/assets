Hi, I am a passionate biotech researcher with a deep interest in human anatomy and developing innovative treatments for diseases. My research journey has led me to Japan, where I am currently pursuing post-graduate studies at the prestigious Laboratory of Protein Biophysics.

My work focuses on understanding protein structures and their role in disease mechanisms, with the goal of developing targeted therapies that can improve human health and longevity. I combine traditional biochemical approaches with cutting-edge computational methods to explore the complex world of cellular biology.

Beyond the laboratory, I maintain a balanced lifestyle through yoga, resistance training, and running. I'm an avid reader who enjoys exploring scientific literature as well as philosophy and fiction. This holistic approach to life informs my research, helping me see connections across disciplines and inspiring innovative solutions to complex problems.
